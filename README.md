**âš  This addon use the size as returned by the GitHub API and may be
innacurate due to how GitHub stores git repositories! See [here][soq] and
[here][ghb] for more informations.**

## Usage

Download the addon from **[addons.mozilla.org][amo]** or, if you prefer, you
can download this project as a userscript on **[OpenUserJs][openjs]** (also
available on the [GitHub releases page][ghreleases]).

### Private Repositories

A **Personal Access Token** from an account with access to the private repository is
required for this addon to work. You can create a Personal Access Token
[here][ghsettings]. **Don't forget to check the `repo` scope.**

The addon will ask for a token automatically the first time you visit a private
repository, you can also show the dialog by clicking on the element added by the
addon or you can visit the addon's settings page (Firefox only).
